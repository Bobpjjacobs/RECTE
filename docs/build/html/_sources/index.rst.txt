Documentation for RECTE
=======================

RECTE (Ramp Effect Charge Trapping Eliminator) models one of the most prominent HST/WFC3/IR systematics. The goals for developing this modelare to improve the precision and efficiency in HST/WFC3/IR time-resolved observations. We detailed the motivation, assumptions, derivations, and applications in `Zhou et al. (2017) <http://stacks.iop.org/1538-3881/153/i=6/a=243?key=crossref.d8632f701456202d40ec5de454a41fff>`_.

We also provide a python package for RECTE that can be easily incorporated in HST/WFC3/IR time-resolved data reduction pipelines. This document demonstrate the installation, usage, and applications for this package. We have also prepared a few Jupyter notebooks for cookbook-style demonstrations.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please file an issue on github or drop the developer an `email <mailto:yifzhou@email.arizona.edu>`_.
